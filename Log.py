"""
Log interface:
* Write info
* Write warning
* Write error
* Define source (text/database/cloud service/etc)
* Log interface won't have a source, and it will be up to the subclasses to determine
  where the messages are sent and how. But any user or factory can instantiate any ILog
  and call log.info and trust that it goes to the right place
* In theory, it would be good to have a BaseLog class, for at least having a common
  base constructor that took in the name of the log. From here, child Log classes could
  define anything else they wanted in their constructor (like a text file path), as long
  as it still included a name for the log. But this is Python, and types don't have to be
  that strict.
